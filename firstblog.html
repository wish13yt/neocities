    <h1>First Article - Wish's Blog</h1>
    <p> Hi! I'm Wish! :) Welcome to my new blog! I don't know what to name this article, so it's just called First Article. I'm pretty new to coding, so my HTML might not be the best. Check out my coding projects below. (they might be hosted here soon!) Anyways, thanks for visiting, and have a good day! </p>
